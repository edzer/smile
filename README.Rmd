The goal of `smile` is to provide an easy to use `R` package that functions to
estimate, predict and interpolate areal data. For estimation and prediction we
use a model-based approach assuming areal data to be an average of an underlying
continuos Gaussian random field. For interpolation, we use the simple areal
interpolation, which is a nonparametric approach. Also, we provide functions to
quantify the uncertainty associated with the simple areal interpolation when the
variance of the observed variables is known.

The package accompanies a web page (powered by
[pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/)) and 5 vignettes.

### Vignettes

1. [Converting `sf` to `spm`
   objects](https://lcgodoy.me/smile/articles/sf-to-spm.html);
2. [Fitting models and making
   predictions](https://lcgodoy.me/smile/articles/fit-and-pred.html);
3. [Areal Interpolation](https://lcgodoy.me/smile/articles/sai.html);
4. [Method](https://lcgodoy.me/smile/articles/theory.html);
5. [Spatial covariance functions](https://lcgodoy.me/smile/articles/sp-cov-functions.html);

### Installation

The package is not on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) yet. Therefore, only
the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) is available. If you
are interested, you can installed using:
```r
## install.packages("smile")
remotes::install_github("lcgodoy/smile")
```
